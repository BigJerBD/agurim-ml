machine learning Agurim
===============
small exploration made with network traffic data from [Agurim](http://mawi.wide.ad.jp/~agurim/)  
to apply simple machine learning algorithm to forecast future network traffic.

this project is not rigorous in his application of machine learning algorithm and clean code.
This is really far from a good practice of clean code 

## Getting Started
These Instructions will allow to setup  the python project to run the jupyter notebooks
### Prerequisites

python3+ is required
jupyter notebook  is required

### Installing
Run in a terminal : 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
