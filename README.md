machine learning Agurim
===============
experimentation of machine learning method with the Data from Agurim.

The objective of experimentation was to apply simple machine learning algorithm to forecast
the traffic in the future.

this project is not rigorous in his application of machine learning and clean code.
This is more a simple exploration of algorithms
